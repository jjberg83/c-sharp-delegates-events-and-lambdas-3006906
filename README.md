C# provides different function types to fit a variety of real-world development scenarios. In this course, Joe Marini explores three important features of C#: Delegates, events, and lambdas. First, Joe shows how delegates are used to provide interchangeable functions during the lifetime of a program, which makes it easy to modify the functionality of an app on the fly. He then covers events, which are used to handle messages from both within and outside the program and can be turned on and off dynamically. Finally, he shows how lambdas provide a concise, efficient way of writing simple expressions without having all the associated syntax of a full function. These features help keep C# code readable, efficient, and maintainable, so join Joe to learn how to adapt this flexible set of programming tools to your own C# programming needs.
